Project 0: Implementing Two Unix/Linux Utilities Part B
Due Wednesday by 1pm Points 5 Submitting a file upload Available after Jan 11 at 6pm
CIS 3207, Section 004 //Spring 2022 //Instructor: Professor Gene Kwatny

The second utility you will build is called tucp, a variant of the UNIX tool cp. In this project,
 this command is used to copy files or a group of files. It creates an exact image (copy) of a file on a disk.
 The tucp command requires at least two filenames in its arguments.

 The following are the possible command usages:
tucp Sourcefile Destinationfile
tucp Sourcefile Directory
tucp Sourcefile-1 Sourcefile-2 Sourcefile-3 Sourcefile-n Directory

 If the tucp command contains two file names, then it copies the contents of the 1st file to the 2nd file.
 If the 2nd file doesnâ€™t exist, then it first creates a file with the specified name and the content of the first
 file is copied to it. But if the second file already exists, then it is simply overwritten without any warning.

 If the tucp command has one or more arguments, specifying source file names and following those arguments,
 an argument specifying a directory name, then the command copies each source file to the destination directory with
 the same source file name. The destination file is created if did not exist, or overwritten if it already existed.
